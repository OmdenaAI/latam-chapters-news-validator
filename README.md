        <p>
            Vosoughi, et al. mentioned that in Twitter from 2006 to 2017 about 126,000 rumors were
            spread by ∼3 million people, where the top 1% of false news cascades diffused to between
            1000 and 100,000 people, whereas the truth rarely diffused to more than 1000 people. Such 
            relevance of not being informed adequately, motivated at the early beginning of this year
            (2022) to the LATAM Chapters of Omdena (Mexico, San Salvador and Colombia) to promote
            and build together their first MVP of fake News Validator in spanish with manual labeling of
            news and tweets.

            The Problem: 
        </h1>
        <p>
            Given the feedback from the judges on Omdena Demo Day (June 8th, 2022) from AWS, UN, 
            Google Org, and Microsoft Philanthropies, and also feedback from +10 surveyed people on our 
            previous MVP, we got a great acceptance. Thus, we have decided to iterate towards improving 
            the open-source codebase, training new models and so on, to build a real time news veracity 
            validator and a plug-in for its use in a web browser. Therefore, we have planned to have two 
            phases to accomplish this project:
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>In the first phase (the current one), we’ll research and implement a context search
                        engine with all the possible models.</li>
                    <li>In the second phase, we’ll try to optimize our models, select the best ones, deploy 
                        them and build a plug-in accordingly.</li>
                </ul>
